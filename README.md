# myarch
Me starting from Archlinux 2021-9-01

Am actually going to attempt to create scripts to help reinstall whenever I decide to do so.
The goal is to create this list of tasks & files once they are created, & keep them updated as changes occur.
Am using ArchWiki, Arco linux, it's Foss & google to find, test & resolve issues.
